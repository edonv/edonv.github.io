I don't wanna be a [B]billionaire, I just want a comfy [F#]place to live
With friends and neighbors al[B]ways around,[B7] they never call me, just [E]walk on in
The doors and windows ain't [B]ever locked, because I don't have any [F#]sh*t to steal
Just a couple comfy [B]chairs to sit, and a pot to cook a [E]family meal [A] [E]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus"}
So [F#]close your eyes and cover [Gº7]up your ears
[G#m]This ain't the message that you [C#7]came to hear
But [Emaj7]I can't help it if I just don't care, [Em6]I don't want to be a billionaire

I'm tired of hearin' about the [B]I.P.O., all of the ways that all the [F#]cash could flow
It would be nice if it would [B]trickle down, [B7]to the people on the other [E]side of town
But something tells me that it [B]probably won't
'Cuz something tells me that it [F#]just ain't right
Taking donations for the [B]1%, out of the pockets of the [E]99 [A] [E]

[B]No, I [F#]don't
[B]No–[C#m]oh[B/D#]oh, [E]I [Em]don't
[B]I don't [F#]wanna be a billio[E]naire [B]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
[F#]I don't want to sacrifice my life tryin' to [E]shave five seconds off a [B]checkout line
[F#]Think of something that the whole world needs: [E]faster fast food de[B]livery
[F#]I don't want to be forced to guess [E]what to do with all of [B]my excess
[C#7]Take vacations into outer space, no no no no no no
Or [F#]pay all [/E]school teachers[/D#] a living [/C#]wage  [F#]
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 3"}
[N.C.]I know nothing's gonna come from [B]this, except for make a couple [F#]people pissed
It ain't effective, far as [B]I can tell, telling the Devil he should [E]go to hell
And I don't even know [B]who's to blame, or who's been marching in the [F#]hit parade
But I don't really wanna [B]sing along, if a computer wrote the [E]f***in' song [A] [E]
