{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
I stay out too [Am]late, got nothing in my [C]brain
That's what people [G]say (mmm mmm), that's what people say (mmm mmm)
I go on too many [Am]dates, but I can't make them [C]stay
At least that's what people [G]say (mmm mmm), that's what people say (mmm mmm)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus"}
But I keep [Am]cruising, can't stop, won't stop [C]moving
It's like I got this [G]music in my mind saying, "It's gonna be alright."
{end_of_pre_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
'Cause the [Am]players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the [C]haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, [G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, I shake it off, I shake it off
Heart[Am]breakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the [C]fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, [G]I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake, I shake it off, I shake it off
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
I never miss a [Am]beat, I'm lightning on my [C]feet
And that's what they don't [G]see (mmm mmm), that's what they don't see (mmm mmm)
I'm dancing on my [Am]own, I make the moves up as I [C]go
And that's what they don't [G]know (mmm mmm)
That's what they don't [* ]know (mmm mmm)
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus"}
But I keep [Am]cruising, can't stop, won't stop [C]moving
It's like I got this [G]music in my mind saying, "It's gonna be alright."

{start_of_post_chorus: label="Post-Chorus"}
[Am]Shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I [C]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I
I [G]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
{end_of_post_chorus}

{start_of_interlude: label="Interlude"}
Hey, hey, hey, just think
While you've been getting down and out
About the liars and the dirty, dirty cheats of the world,
You could've been getting down to this sick beat
{end_of_interlude}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like "Oh, my god!" but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby? We can shake, shake, shake
{end_of_bridge}

[Am]Shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I [C]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I
I [G]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
[Am]Shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I [C]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I
I [G]shake it off, I shake it off, I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
