[G]  State the [Am]obvious
I [C]didn’t get my [D]perfect fantasy
[G]  I rea[Am]lize you love your[C]self
More than you could [D]ever love me
[G]  So go and [Am]tell your fr[C]iends
That I’m ob[D]sessive and [G]crazy
That’s [Am]fine, you won't [C]mind if I [D]say
And by the [C]way, I hate that
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 1"}
[G]Stupid old [Am]pickup truck
You [C]never let me [D]drive
You’re a [G]redneck, [Am]heartbreak
Who’s [C]really bad at [D]lying
[G]  So watch me [Am]strike a [C]match
On all my [D]wasted time
As [C]far as I’m concerned you’re
[D]Just another picture to burn

[G]  There’s no [Am]time for tears,
I’m just [C]sitting here
[D]Planning my re[G]venge
There’s nothing [Am]stopping me
From [C]going out with
[D]All of your best friends
[G]  And if you [Am]come a[C]round
Saying [D]sorry to me
My [G]daddy’s gonna [Am]show you
How [C]sorry you’ll [D]be, cause I hate that

And [C]if you’re missing me,
You’d better [D]keep it to yourself
Cause [C]coming back around [G6add11]here
Would be [D]bad for your health cause
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 3"}
I hate that [G]stupid old [Am]pickup truck
You [C]never let [D]me drive
You’re a [G]redneck, [Am]heartbreak
Who’s [C]really bad at [D]lying
[G]  So watch me [Am]strike a [C]match
On all my [D]wasted time
In [C]case you haven't heard
I [D]really really hate that
