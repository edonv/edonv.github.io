[Am]Written in these walls are the [*/]stories that I can't ex[C]plain [*/]
I [Am]leave my heart open but it [*/]stays right here empty for [C]days [*/]
She [Am]told me in the morning she don't [F]feel the same about us in her [C]bones [*/]
[Am]Seems to me that when I die these [F]words will be written on my [C]stone [*/]

And I'll be [F]go[* –]ne, [G]gone toni[Am]ght
The ground beneath my [F]fee[*–]t is [G]open w[Am]ide

I [F]spend her love un[*/]til she's broke in[Am]side

Al[Am]though I am broken, my [F]heart is untamed [C]still [*/]
