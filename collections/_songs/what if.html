I [C]drive across bridges so [*/]worried about falling that I [F]miss the view [*  /]
Already [C]watching the news reports [*/]saying, \
"there was nothing any[F]one could do" [*  /]

[*Dm –]In [*C/E –]my [F]mind, what if I [Am]fall [*  /]
What if it's [*Dm –]in [*C/E –]my [F]mind

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
What if I [C]fly,[*  /] [* ]get a little hi[F]gher [*  /]
Get out of my [Am]head for a minute, \
and [*/]just feel the wind on my [F]face [*  /]
Maybe the [C]fear[*  /] [* ]just means I'm a[F]live [*  /]
Maybe I'll [Am]fall,[*  F~] [* ]but what if I...
[C] [* ]Fl[*Dm –]y, [*C/E –] [F] [* ]fl[*/ –]y, [*G –] \

I [C]think of you, pick up my [*/]phone, then put it [F]down again [*  /]
There's [C]no way for you to re[*/]ply to the messages I [F]never send [*  /]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus 2"}
[*Dm –]In [*C/E –]my [F]mind, we'd never [Am]fall in love [*  /]
But what if I'm [*Dm –]on [*C/E –]your [F]mind

Yeah, when I [G]get to the end of my [*/]life, \
I wanna know that I[* F~] [* ]used my [*/]time
So what if I [C]fall[*  /] [* ]straight out of the [F]sky [*  /]
Would I rather [Am]look back and wonder, \
or [*/]know that I actually tr[F]ied [*  /]
