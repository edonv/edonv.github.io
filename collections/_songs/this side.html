[E]One day you'll se[C#5]e her and you'll [Asus2]know what I [B5]mean
[E]Take her or lea[C#5]ve her, she will [Asus2]still be the [B5]same [Cº7]
[C#m]She'll not [G#]try to [Asus2]buy you with her [B5]time
[E]Nothing's the sa[C#5]me as you will [Asus2]see when she's [B5]gone

It's [A*]foreign on this [B5]side, and I'll [C#5]not leave my [F#m]home a[Asus2]gain
[B5]There's no place to [C#5]hide, and I'm [A#ø7]nothin' but sc[Asus2]ared [B5]

[E]You dream of co[C#5]lors that have [Asus2]never been [B5]made
You i[E]magine [C#5]songs that have [Asus2]never been [B5]played [Cº7]
[C#m]They will [G#]try to [Asus2]buy you and your [B5]mind
For [E]only the [C#5]curious have [Asus2]something to [B5]find

It's [A*]foreign on this [B5]side, and the [C#5]truth is a [F#m]bitter frie[Asus2]nd
[B5]Reasons, few have [C#5]I to [A#ø7]go back a[Asus2]gain

[N.C.]Your first dawn blinded you, left you cursing the day
Entrance is crucial and it's not without pain [Cº7]
[C#m]There's no [G#]path to fo[Asus2]llow once you're [B5]here
[E]Climb up the sl[C#5]ide and then you'll [Asus2]slide down the [B5]stairs

It's [A*]foreign on this [B5]side, but it [C#5]feels like I'm [F#m]home a[Asus2]gain
[B5]There's no place to [C#5]hide, but I [A#ø7]don't think I'm sc[Asus2]ared
