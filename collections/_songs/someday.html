I [D]know it might be crazy, but [A]did you hear the story?
I [Em]think I heard it vaguely, a [G]girl and a zombie
[D] [* ]Oh, tell me more, boy (yeah),[A] [* ]sounds like a fantasy
Oh, [Em]what could go so wrong with a [G]girl and a zombie?
[D]You're from the perfect paradise, and [A]I'm living on the darker side
[Em]Ooh, I've got a feeling, [G]if you get to know me
[D]Right from the start you caught my eye, and [A]something inside me came to life
[Em]Ooh, I've got a feeling, [G]if you get to know me

Well, [Em]now you're getting fearless. No, [G]I'm just rooting for us
If [D]different was a super power, [A]we'd be so flawless
[Em]Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours, [G]I'm rooting for us
[D]Two lonely hearts meet in the dark, i[A]magine it now they start a spark
[Em]You got my attention,[G] [* ]what happens next, then?
[D]Movies and long walks in the park, [A]hanging out anywhere we want
I [Em]like the way you're thinking, [G]I can almost see it
