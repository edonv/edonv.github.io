[G]Where did my wings go[G/C]?
I could've sworn I could f[G/B]ly
Straight up into the s[G/C]ky
[G]Boy, I should have kno[G/C]wn
It was all just a l[G/B]ie
No one on earth can f[G/C]ly

[Am7] [* ]Thought the things you sa[D7]id would [D7sus4]turn out true
[Am7] [* ]Guess that's what I [D7]get for [D7sus4]trusting you
[Am7] [* ]You said if I bel[C]ieved enou[D]gh, I would fly  [G]
[G/C] [* ]Why didn't I?  [G/B]    [G/C]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[G]Did faith let me do[G/C]wn
Or did I not have enou[G/B]gh?
That distinction is tou[G/C]gh
[G]Still, I thought your ha[G/C]nds
Protected me from the f[G/B]all
Did you mean that at a[G/C]ll?

[Am7] [* ]Thought the things you sa[D7]id would turn out true
[Am7] [* ]Was it even y[D7]ou I listened to?
[Am7] [* ]I thought if I bel[C]ieved enou[D]gh, I would fly

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
[Cmaj7] [/E]Air is rushing [D]past, and I can barely [G/B]see
[Cmaj7] [* ]Se[/E]ems like this [D]fall will be the death of [G/B]me
[Cmaj7] [/E]Any second [D]now, the ground will come to [G/B]take me[Cmaj7] [* ]home  [G/B]

[Cmaj7] [/E]Suddenly, a [D]peace that I cannot ex[G/B]plain
[Cmaj7]  [* ]F[/E]eels like the [D]wind is running through m[G/B]y veins
[Cmaj7] [* ]Oh, and [/E]all that I can [D]do is close my eyes as you [G/B]lift m[C]e up
You lift m[D]e up

[Am7] [* ]All that I know no[D7]w is sky and cloud
[Am7] [* ]Don't know when my fee[D7]t last touched the ground
