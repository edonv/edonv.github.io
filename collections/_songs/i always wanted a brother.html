When I am [D]king, no other [G]animal will break my [Em]stride, break my [A]stride
And my [D]brother, my brother, when I'm [G]king
You'll always take my [Em]side. Ha! Yeah, [A]right, that's right
When you are [D]king, no other [G]animal will break our [Em]pride, break our [A]pride
And my [D]brother, my brother, our prey may [G]run away
But they can't [Em]hide, watch your [A]hide
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 1"}
Let's go, let's go, let's [D]go!
Hey, did your [G]Mama say you could be [Em]up this late?
Okay, she didn't [A]say, either way, hide away, let's [D]go!
Hey, did your [G]Father say you could be [Em]out this far?
Okay, we're on our [A]way, on our way, run away, let's [D]go!
Hey, did your [G]Mama say you could be [Em]up this late?
Ha-ha! You're v–µry [A]sharp, yes you are, yes you are, let's [D]go!

You see that [D]tree?
Those birds are [G]watching the world un[Em]fold, the world un[A]fold
Oh, [D]brother, my brother, when I'm [G]king, they will do as they're [Em]told
You may look [A]down on them
But they are [D]free, you can't catch me, and where they [G]go cannot be con[Em]trolled
No one looks [A]down on me
They look [D]down on us, brother. Ha![G] [* ]Some things you chase but you cannot [Em]hold
Okay, it's getting [A]old

Hey, did your [G]Mama say that you could [Em]learn this way?
I've got to find a [A]way, find our prey, fine, I'll wait, let's [D]go!
Hey, I heard his [G]father say he doesn't [Em]want this stray
I [A]dare you to say that again to my face

[Bm]What did you say 'bout my [E]brother? [Bm]That's not a stray, that's my [E]brother
[G]You stay away from my brother, 'cause [D]I say so
If [Bm]you put your paws on my[E7]brother, [Bm]you'll meet the jaws of his[E7]brother
[G]Those are the laws for my brother,[D] [N.C.]where'd he go?
