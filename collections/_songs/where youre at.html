I keep my [Am]dirt on the [F]surface so you [Dm]don't gotta [G]dig [G#º7]
The [Am]people didn't make [F]me nervous, tried to [F/G]hide all their [C]sins
And [Am]I've got no [F]reason to [Dm]cover my [G]tracks, ye[G#º7]ah
My [Am]favorite part [F]of learning is just [F/G]loving where I'm [C]at

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
So [Cmaj7]love where you're [Em7]at, yeah [F]love where you're [G]at [G#º7]
And keep your [Am]dirt on the [F]surface and just [F/G]love where you're [C]at
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
I wear my [Am]sins on my [F]collar so that [Dm]everyone can [G]see [G#º7]
And well, [Am]there ain't no [F]bother in spreading no [F/G]rumors about [C]me
Oh well, [Am]I ain't no [F]angel, but baby [Dm]I ain't so [G]bad [G#º7]
And my [Am]favorite part of [F]learning is just [F/G]loving where I'm [C]at
