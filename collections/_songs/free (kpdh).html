[F] [* ]I tried to hide, but something broke
[Am] [* ]I tried to sing, couldn't hit the notes
The words [G]kept catching in my throat
[Em] [* ]I tried to smile, I was suffocating though
But[F] [* ]here with you, I can finally breathe
You say[Am] [* ]you're no good, but you're good for me
I've been[G] [* ]hoping to change, now I know we can change
But I [Em]won't if you're not by my side

Why does it f[F]eel right every time I let you in?
[*G]Why d[*–]oes it [Am]feel like I can tell you anything?
All the [G]secrets that keep me in chains and
All the [*/]damage that might make me dangerous
[Em]You g[* –]ot a d[F]ark side, guess you're not the only one
[G]What i[* –]f we b[Am]oth tried fighting what we're running from?
We can't [G]fix it if we never face it
What if [*/]we find a way to escape it?

[Em]We co[* –]uld be[F] [* ]free, [*G – Am]free

[Em] [*  –]Ooh, [F]time goes by, and I lose pers[*G   –]pective
[*–]Yeah, [Am]hope only hurts, so I just forget it
But you're [G]breaking through all the dark in me \
when I thought that nobody could
And you're [*/]waking up all these parts of me \
that I [N.C.]thought were buried for good
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 3"}
Between im[F]poster and this monster, I been lost inside my [*G   –]head
[*–]Ain't no [Am]choice when all these voices keep me pointing towards no end
It's just [G]easy when I'm with you, no one sees me the way you do
I don't [*/]trust it, but I want to, I keep coming back to
