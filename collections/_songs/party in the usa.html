I [G]hopped off the plane at [Bm]L.A.X., with a [Em]dream and my cardiga[D]n
[G]Welcome to the land of[Bm] fame excess[Em], am I gonna fit in?[D]
[G]Jumped in the cab, here I[Bm] am for the first[Em] time
Look to my right and I see the Hol[D]lywood sign
[G] [* ]This is all so [Bm]crazy, [Em]everybody seems so famous[D]
[G] [* ]My tummy's turnin' and I'm [Bm]feelin' kinda home [Em]sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous[D]
That's when the [G]taxi man turned on the [Bm]radio
[Em]And a Jay-Z song was on[D], and a [N.C.]Jay-Z song was on, and a Jay-Z song was on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
So I put my [G]hands up, they're [Bm]playing my song, the [Em]butterflies fly away[D]
I'm [G]noddin' my head like [Bm]yeah, [Em]movin' my hips like yeah[D]
I put my [G]hands up, they're [Bm]playing my song, I [Em]know I'm gonna be OK[D]
[G]Yea[Bm]h, [Em]it's a party in the USA[D]
[G]Yea[Bm]h, [Em]it's a party in the USA[D]

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[G] [* ]Get to the club in my [Bm]taxi cab, [Em]everybody's looking at me now[D]
Like, “[G]Who's that chick that's [Bm]rockin' kicks?[Em] She gotta be from out of town.”[D]
[G] [* ]So hard with my [Bm]girls not around [Em]me, it's definitely not a Nashville par[D]ty
[G] [* ]'Cause all I see are sti[Bm]lettos[Em], I guess I never got the memo[D]
[G] [* ]My tummy's turnin' and I'm [Bm]feelin' kinda home [Em]sick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous[D]
That's when the [G]taxi man turned on the [Bm]radio
It's when the [G]DJ dropped my [Bm]favorite tune[Em]
And a Britney song was on[D], and a [N.C.]Britney song was on, and a Britney song was on
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
[Bm] [* ]Feel like hoppin' on a [Em]flight
[Bm] [* ]Back to my hometown to[Am]night
[Bm] [* ]Something stops me every[Em]time
The [C]DJ plays my song and I feel alright [D]
