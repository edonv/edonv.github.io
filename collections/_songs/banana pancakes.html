Well can't you see that it's just rai[Am7]nin', there ain't no need to go outside[G7]

But [D7]ba[D7]by, you [G7]hardly even [D7]notice [Am7]when I try to [C7]show you
This [G7]song is meant to [D7]keep you from [Am7]doin' what you're su[C7]pposed to
[G7]Wakin' up too [D7]early, [Am7]maybe we could [C7]sleep in
[G7]Make you banana [D7]pancakes, pre[Am7]tend like it's the [C7]weekend [Am7]now
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
And we could pretend it all the [G7]time
Can't you see that it's just [Am7]rainin'
There ain't no need to go [G7]outside
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
But just [D7]may[D7]be, [G7]laka uku[D7]lele, [Am7]Mama made a [C7]baby
[G7]Really don't mind to [D7]practice because [Am7]you're my little [C7]lady
[G7]Lady, lady, [D7]love me, 'cause I [Am7]love to lay here [C7]lazy
[G7]We could close the [D7]curtains, pre[Am7]tend like there's no [C7]world [Am7]outside
{end_of_verse}

{chorus: label=""}

{start_of_postchorus: label="Post-Chorus"}
Ain't no need, ain't no [Am7]need, mmmm mmmm[G7]
Can't you see, can't you [Am7]see, rain all day and I don't [G7]mind
{end_of_postchorus}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
But the [Am7]telephone's singing, ringing
It's too early, don't pick it [D]up, we don't need to
We got [Am7]everything we need right here
And everything we need is e[D]nough
Just so easy when the [Bm]whole world fits inside of your arms
Do we [Em]really need to pay attention to the alarm?
Wake up [G7]slow, mmmm [Am7]mmmm, wake up [G7]slow
{end_of_bridge}

Ain't no need, ain't no [Am7]need, rain all day and I [G7]really, really, really don't mind
Can't you see, can't you [Am7]see, you gotta wake up [G7]slow
