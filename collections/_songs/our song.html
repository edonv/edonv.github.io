{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
I was [D]ridin' shotgun with my [Em]hair undone in the [G]front seat of his [A]car
He's got a [D]one-hand feel on th[Em]e steering wheel, the [G]other on my[A] [* ]heart
[D] [* ]I look around, turn the [Em]radio down, he says [G]baby is something [A]wrong?
I [D]say, “Nothin', I was [Em]just thinkin' how [G]we don't have a [A]song”
[N.C.] [* ]And he says
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
[D] [* ]Our song is the [Em]slammin' screen door
[G]Sneakin' out late, tappin' [A]on your window
[D] [* ]When we're on the ph[Em]one and you talk re[G]al slow
'Cause it's [A]late and your mama don't [D]know
Our song is the [Em]way you laugh
The [G]first date, “Man, I didn't [A]kiss her and I should have”
[Em] [* ]And when I got [A]home, 'fore I said “A[Em]men”
Askin' Go[D]d if [G]he[N.C.] [* ]could play it again

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[D] [* ]I was walking up the [Em]front porch steps after [G]everythin' [A]that day
Had [D]gone all wrong or been [Em]trampled on, and [G]lost and thrown a[A]way
[D]Got to the hallway, [Em]well on my way [G]to my lovin' [A]bed
I [D]almost didn't notice [Em]all the roses, [G]and the note that[A] [* ]said

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
I've [Em]heard every album, listened [G]to the radio
Wa[D]ited for s[A]omethin' to co[Em]me along
That was as [G]good as our song
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus: label="Last Chorus"}
[D] [* ]'Cause our song is the [Em]slammin' screen door
[G]Sneakin' out late, tappin' [A]on his win[D]dow
When we're on the [Em]phone and he talks real [G]slow
'Cause it's [N.C.]late [A]and his mama don't [D]know
Our song is the [Em]way he laughs
The [G]first date, “Man, I didn't [A]kiss her and I should have”
[Em] [* ]And when I got [A]home, 'fore I said “A[Em]men”
Askin' Go[D]d if [G]he could play it a[D]gain

{start_of_outro: label="Outro"}
I was [D]ridin' shotgun with my [Em]hair undone in the [G]front seat of his [A]car
[D] [* ]I grabbed a pen and an [Em]old napkin, and I[G] wrote down our song
