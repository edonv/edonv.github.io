[*N.C.]Five, six, five, six, seven, eight
[D]  "Baby doll, you have [G]changed"
That's the thing you always [D]say
Cursin' me, trash my [G]name
I rained all over your pa[D]rade
Now you're on my couch, you're fightin' [G]tears
You say I'm cruel beyond my [D]years
And as I'm walkin' out that [G]door
Say you don't know me any[C]mo-[G]ore
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
[D]I have captors I call friends
I got [G]panic rooms inside my head
[C]I get down with crooked men
But I [D]am the girl I've always been
I got [D]wrapped up in the game again
You [G]woke up in an empty bed
And I [C]can't say I'm a [G]perfect ten
But I [*D*]am the girl I've always been
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
So don't say that I've been ac[*D]ting [*G*]different
I'm nothin' if I'm not [*G]con[*D*]sistent
You knew everything you'd [*D]be [*G*]gettin'
I told you right from the be[D]ginnin'
Now you're on my case, how could I [G]go?
You never dreamed I'd be so [D]cold
And then, with venom on your [G]tongue
You ask who I have be[C]co[G]ome, well...
{end_of_verse}

{chorus}

{start_of_outro: label="Outro"}
Yeah, [*D*]I'm a candle in the wind
I'll [*D*]turn you out, I'll turn you in
But I [*D*]am the girl I've always been
