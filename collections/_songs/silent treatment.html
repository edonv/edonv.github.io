{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
[C] [* ]You played it cool, and I played it [Em]dumb
Don't you think I'm a little too [G]young to be messed with like that? [*/]
[C] [* ]So convincing, you made it look [Em]fun
Laugh it off, but the damage is [G]done, saying, “Baby, just relax” [*/]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus 1"}
[Am]I got my hopes too high, [Bm]you hardly said goodbye
Then [C]casually walked out of my [*D*]life
{end_of_pre_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 1"}
Oh, we don't [C]talk anymore, talk anymore, talk any[G]more
Gave me the silent treatment [D]
The least you could've done was [Em]give me a reason
And [C]I can't ignore, I can't ignore, I can't ig[G]nore
The way I hate you for lea[D]ving
Too much free time staring [Em]up at the ceiling
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[C] [* ]It's been a month since you went and checked [G]in
I wanna ask, “Where the heck have you [D]been?”
'Cause I've been right where you left me [Em]
[C] [* ]Poured my self-control down the [G]sink
Almost die every time the phone [D]rings
Why won't somebody help [Em]me?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus 2"}
[Am]I got my hopes too high, [Bm]read in between the lines
[C]Am I supposed to read your [*D*]mind?
{end_of_pre_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 2"}
Oh, we don't [*N.C.]talk anymore, talk anymore, talk any[*/]more
Gave me the silent treatment [D]
The least you could've done was [Em]give me a reason
And [C]I can't ignore, I can't ignore, I can't ig[G]nore
The way I hate you for lea[D]ving
Too much free time staring [Em]up at the ceiling
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
[Am] [* ]You're a narcissist, I'm an o[Bm]ptimist
Name a deadlier comb[C]o
Something's wrong with us, ain't it o[D]bvious?
Build me up and then, oh n[Am]o
Call me “just a friend,” here we g[Bm]o again
Tell them all that you hate m[C]e, hate me, guess you e[*D*]rased me
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_chorus: label="Final\nChorus"}
'Cause we don't [*C*]talk anymore, talk anymore, talk any[*G*]more
Gave me the silent treatment [*D*]
Did you go find someone, or [Em]am I the reason?
And [C]I can't ignore, I can't ignore, I can't ig[G]nore
The way I hate you for lea[D]ving
Too much free time staring [Em]up at the ceiling
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_outro: label="Outro"}
[C] [* ]Give me a r[G]eason for the tr[D]eatment I've been [Em]feeling
[C] [* ]Give me a r[G]eason for you l[D]eaving, I've been [Em]screaming [*C*]
