All of these [A]lines across my face, tell you the st[E7]ory of who I am
So many st[F#m]ories of where I've been, and how I [Asus4]got to where I am
But these [A]stories don't mean [E7]anything, when you've [F#m]got no one to [Asus4]tell them to
It's [A]true, [E7]I was made for [A]you [*Asus4-A]

I climbed a[A]cross the mountain tops, swam all a[E7]cross the ocean blue
I crossed all the [F#m]laws and I broke all the rules, and baby I [Asus4]broke them all for you
Oh, because [A]even when I [E7]was flat broke, you [F#m]made me feel like a [Asus4]million bucks
[A]You do, [E7]I was made for [A]you [*Asus4-A]

[N.C.]You see the smile that's on my mouth it's hidin' the [E7]words that don't come out
All of the [F#m]friends who think that I'm blessed, they don't [Asus4]know my head is a mess
No, [A]they don't know who [E7]I really am and [F#m]they don't know what [Asus4]I've been through
Like [A]you do, and [E7]I was made for [A]you [*Asus4-A]
