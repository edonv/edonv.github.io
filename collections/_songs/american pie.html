A [G]long, [D/F#]long [Em7]time ago
[Am]I can still re[C]member how that [Em]music used to make me [D]smile [D]
And [G]I knew [D/F#]if I [Em7]had my chance
That [Am]I could make those [C]people dance and [Em]maybe they'd be [C]happy for a [D]while [D]
But [Em]February m[Am]ade me shiver, with [Em]every paper [Am]I'd deliver
[C]Bad news [C/B]on the [Am]doorstep, I [C]couldn't take one [D]more step [D]
I [G]can't rem[D/F#]ember [Em]if I cried when I [Am7]read about his [D]widowed bride
[G]Something [D/F#]touched me [Em]deep inside
The [C]day the [D7]music [G]died
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
So [G]bye, [C]bye Miss A[G]merican [D]Pie
Drove my [G]Chevy to the [C]levy but the [G]levy was [D]dry
And them [G]good old b[C]oys were drinkin' [G]whiskey and [D]rye
Singin' [*Em*]this will be the day that I [*A7*]die, [*Em*]this will be the day that I [D7]die [D7]
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[G]Did you write the [Am]book of love
And do [C]you have faith in [Am]God above,[Em] if the bible [D]tells you so?[D]
Do [G]you bel[D/F#]ieve in [Em]rock and roll
Can [Am7]music save your[C] mortal soul and[Em] can you teach me [A7]how to dance [D]real slow?[D]
Well I [*Em*]know that you're in [*D*]love with him 'cuz I[*Em*] saw you dancin' [*D*]in the gym
You [C]both kicked [C/B]off your sh[Am]oes, man I [C]dig those rhythm and bl[D7]ues
I was a [G]lonely [D/F#]teenage [Em]bronckin' buck with a [Am]pink carnation and a [C]pickup truck
But [G]I knew [D/F#]I was [Em]out of luck the [C]day the [D7]music [G]died,[C] [G] I started [D]singin'
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 3"}
Now for [G]ten years we've been [Am]on our own
and [C]moss grows fat on a [Am]rolling stone but[Em] that's not how it [D]used to be [D]
When the [G]jester [D/F#]sang for the [Em]king and queen
in a [Am7]coat he borrowed fr[C]om James Dean in a [Em]voice that [A7]came from you and [D]me [D]
Oh, and[*Em*] while the king was [*D*]looking down, the [*Em*]jester stole his[*D*]thorny crown
The [C]courtroom [C/B] was adjo[A7]urned, [C]no verdict was re[D7]turned
And while [G]Lennin [D/F#]read a [Em]book on Marx, the [Am]quartet practiced [C]in the park
And [G]we sang [D/F#]dirges [Em]in the dark the [C]day the m[D7]usic [G]died,[C] [G] we were [D]singin'

[G]Helter skelter [Am]in a summer swelter
the [C]birds flew off with a [Am]fallout shelter,[Em] eight miles high and[D] fallin' f[D]a-a[G]st
It landed [D/F#]foul [Em]on the grass
the [Am7]players tried for a [C]forward pass, with the [Em]jester on the [A7]sidelines in a [D]cast [D]
Now the [*Em*]half-time air was [*D*]sweet perfume, while[*Em*] sergeants played a [*D*]marching tune
[C]We all got [C/B]up to d[A7]ance, but we[C] never got the [D7]chance
'Cuz the [G]players [D/F#]tried to [Em]take the field, [Am]the marching band re[Cm]fused [C]to yield
[G]Do you rec[D/F#]all what [Em]was revealed the d[C]ay the [D7]music [G]died,[C] [G] we started [D]singin'

[G]And there we were all [Am]in one place
a [C]generation [Am]lost in space, with [Em]no time left to [D]start again [D]
So come on [G]Jack be [D/F#]nimble, [Em]Jack be quick, [Am7]Jack Flash sat on a [C]candle stick, 'cuz
[Em] fire is the [A7]devil's only [D]friend [D]
[*Em*]And as I watched him [*D*]on the stage, my [*Em*]hands were clenched in [*D*]fists of rage
[C]No angel [C/B]born in [A7]Hell could [C]break that Satan's [D7]spell
And as the [G]flames climbed [D/F#]high in[Em]to the night to [Am]light the sacri[C]ficial rite
I saw [G]Satan [D/F#]laughing [Em]with delight the d[C]ay the [D7]music [G]died,[C] [G] he was [D]singin'

[*G*] I met a [*D/F#*]girl who [*Em*]sang the blues
And [*Am*]I asked her for some [*C*]happy news, [*Em*]but she just smiled and [*D*]turned away [*(D*)]
[*G*]I went [*D/F#*]down to the [*Em*]sacred store
Where [*Am*]I'd heard the music [*C*]years before, but the [*Em*]man there said the [*C*]music
wouldn't [*D*]play [*(D*)]
But [*Em*]in the streets the [*Am*]children screamed, the [*Em*]lovers cried and the [*Am*]poets dreamed
But [*C*]not a [*C/B*]word was [*Am*]spoken, the [*C*]church bells all were [*D*]broken
And the [*G*]three me[*D/F#*]n I ad[*Em*]mire most, the [*Am7*]Father, Son, and the [*D7*]Holy Ghost
[*G*]They caught the [*D/F#*]last train [*Em*]for the coast the [*C*]day the [*D7*]music [*G*]died
[*N.C.]And they were singin'
