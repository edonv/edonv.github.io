From the [C]paper um[Am]brellas in [B7]both of our [F]drinks
To the [C]shadows that [F]walk with[G]out [C]us
My a[C]ccount of the [Am]details is as [B7]clear as you'd [F]think
Kept up by [C]friends that [F]still ask a[G]bout [C]us
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 1"}
If our [C]lives were a movie, if our [F]lives were a book
It'd be [C]longer than I'd recom[F]mend
'Cause if you're [C]telling a story, at [E]some point you stop
But [Am]stories [G]don't [Fm]end

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
The re[C]mains of a [Am]person, the [B7]habits of a [F]ghost
You could st[C]ill find in the [F]places you [G]used [C]to
Still [C]reading off cu[Am]e cards and [B7]raising a [F]toast
To the [C]stories I [F]still tell a[G]bout [C]you
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_prechorus: label="Pre-Chorus 1"}
But the [Dm]plot line wanders and versions change
And I [Am]don't know where to [F]quit
{end_of_prechorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 2"}
If I tried to [C]show every side of you through [F]words of a song
I'd say a [C]fraction of what I'd in[F]tend
'Cause if you're [C]telling a story, at [E]some point you stop
But [Am]stories [G]don't [Fm]end
{end_of_chorus}

{sob: label="Bridge"}
[G]  The next time I [C]see you and my [F]conscience tells [G]me
That the [G]episode has [C]long since been [F]closed
But [G]he's not the [C]one that gets up [F]every mor[G]ning
And wonders [G]how long a [C]memory keeps its [F]pose
And [G]how much that the [C]man beside you [F]knows
And [G]how much of the [C]toll it's taken [F]shows [Fm] [C7]

Like a [Dm]famous singer that lost his voice
That we [Am]all still want to [F]meet
{end_of_prechorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 3"}
If our [C]lives were a movie, if our [F]lives were a book
It'd be [C]longer than I could de[F]fend
'Cause if you're [C]telling a story, at [E]some point you stop
But [Am]stories [G]don't [Fm]end
[Am]Stories d[G]on't [Fm]end
No, [Am]stories [G]don't [Fm]end
