[Emaj7]Sun in the sky, I[Bm7]  feel like somebody
[Amaj7]Closing my eyes, da[Cmaj7]ncing with nobody

[Emaj7]Sun in the sky, I[Bm7]  feel like somebody
[Amaj7]Closing my eyes, da[Cmaj7]ncing with nobody
[Emaj7]Clouds in my mind, h[Bm7]eaded for the lobby
[Amaj7]Closing my eyes, da[Cmaj7]ncing with nobody

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
[Emaj7]  I remember days feeling like lost [Bm7]time
Tripping over lines that I tried to [Amaj7]rhyme
In too deep, nearly lost my [Cmaj7]mind (ooh, [N.C.]woah)
[Emaj7]Sooner or later they gon' call you [Bm7]back
Domino effect and they all re[Amaj7]act
Feeling like I'm living in re[Cmaj7]wind

{start_of_refrain: label="Refrain"}
And I know[Emaj7]  things gon' change, no there ain't[Bm7]  stoppin' fate
All the c[Amaj7]olors arrange, so I l[Cmaj7]et it all fade
And I know[Emaj7]  things gon' change, no there ain't[Bm7]  stoppin' fate
All the c[Amaj7]olors arrange, so I l[Cmaj7]et it all fade

If [Emaj7]you don't really care who [N.C.]sees, [Bm7]come on, won't you dance with me?
Ayy, if [Amaj7]you don't really care who [N.C.]sees, [Cmaj7]come on, won't you dance with me?
If [Emaj7]you don't really care who [N.C.]sees, [Bm7]come on, won't you dance with me?

[Emaj7]Feel the light in[Bm7]side, don't let it go [Amaj7] [Cmaj7]
