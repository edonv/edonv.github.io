[D]  Like the pine trees [A]linin' the [A#º7]windin' [Bm]road
I've [/A]got a [G]name,[A]  I've got a [*D (Riff 1)]name
[D]  Like the singin' [A]bird and the [A#º7]croakin' [Bm]toad
I've [/A]got a [E7]name, I've got a [A7]name

[F#m]  And I carry it [G]with me like my [D]daddy did
[A#º7]  But I'm livin' the [Bm]dream[E7]  that he kept [A7]hid
{end_of_pre_chorus}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus\n(Riff 2x)"}
[F#m]Movin' me down the [G]highway
[F#m]Rollin' me down the [B]highway
[G]Movin' ahead so [A]life won't pass me [*C (Riff 2)]by
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
[D]  Like the north wind [A/C#]whistlin' down the [Bm]sky
I've got a [G]song,[A]  I've got a [*D (Riff 1)]song
[D]  Like the whippoor[A/C#]will and the baby's [Bm]cry
I've got a [E7]song, I've got a [A7]song
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus 2"}
[F#m]  And I carry it [G]with me and I [D]sing it loud
[A#º7]  If it gets me [Bm]nowhere,[E7]  I'll go there [A7]proud

[D]  Like the fool I [A/C#]am and I'll always [Bm]be
I've got a [G]dream,[A]  I've got a [*D (Riff 1)]dream
[D]  They can change their [A/C#]minds but they can't change [Bm]me
I've got a [E7]dream, I've got a [A]dream
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_pre_chorus: label="Pre-Chorus 3"}
[F#m]  Oh, I know I could [G]share it if you [D]want me to
[A#º7]  If you're going [Bm]my way,[*E7*]  I'll go with [A7]you
