**SwiftDex** is an iOS app that functions as an encyclopedia of useful information about Pok√©mon to be used when playing the games. It contains information such as stats, moves, abilities, evolutions, types, and natures.

**SwiftDex** is written in pure Swift and all the data the app uses is stored in XML files. The XML files were generated using a complex scraper program written in C#.
