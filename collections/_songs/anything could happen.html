[G] [* ]Stripped to the waist, we fall into the ri[G]ver
[G] [* ]Cover your eyes so you don't know the se[G]cret… I've been trying to [C]hide
We held our breath to see our names are wri[C]tten… on the wreck of '8[G]6
That was the year I knew the panic was o[G]ver
Yes, since we found [Am]out, since we found out

But now I've seen it [Am]through, and now I know the truth
