{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
Loving him is like [F]driving a new Maser[Am]ati down a dead end st[G]reet [Gsus4]
[F]Faster than the wind, passio[Am]nate as sin, ended so [G]suddenly
Loving him is like [F]trying to change your mind
Once you're [Am]already flying through the f[G]ree fall
Like the [F]colors in autumn so br[Am]ight, just before they l[G]ose it all [N.C.]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus"}
Losing him was [F]blue, like I'd never [C]known
Missing him was [G]dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was [F]like trying to know someb[Am]ody you never [G]met
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_post_chorus: label="Post-Chorus 1"}
But loving him was [F]red (re-e-e-ed, [Am]re-e-e-ed[G], [* ]re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Loving him was [F]red (re-e-e-ed, [Am]re-e-e-ed[G], [* ]re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
{end_of_post_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
Touching him was like [F]realizing all you ever [Am]wanted was right there in [G]front of you
Memorizing him was as [F]easy as knowing all the [Am]words to your old favorite [G]song
Fighting with him was like [F]trying to solve a crossword
And [Am]realizing there's no right an[G]swer
Regretting him was like [F]wishing you never found o[Am]ut that love could be that[G] [* ]strong
{end_of_verse}

{chorus: label=""}

{start_of_post_chorus: label="Post-Chorus 2"}
But loving him was [F]red (re-e-e-ed, [Am]re-e-e-ed), oh, [G]red (re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
Burning [F]red (re-e-e-ed, [Am]re-e-e-ed[G], [* ]re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
{end_of_post_chorus}

{start_of_bridge: label="Bridge"}
Remembering him comes in [F]flashbacks and e[G]choes
Tell myself it's [Am]time now gotta [G/B]let go
But [C]moving on from [F]him is impossible
When [C/E]I still see it all in my[G] [* ]head
{end_of_bridge}

{start_of_interulde: label="Interlude"}
In burning [F]red [Am] [G]
Burning, it [F]was re[Am]eeee[G]ed
{end_of_interulde}

{start_of_chorus: label="Final Chorus"}
Oh, losing him was [F]blue, like I'd [N.C.]never [C]known [N.C.]
Missing him was [G]dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was [F]like trying to know someb[Am]ody you never [G]met
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_post_chorus: label="Post-Chorus 3"}
'Cause loving him was [F]red, [Am]yeah, yeah, [G]red
Oh, burning [F]red (re-e-e-ed, [Am]re-e-e-ed[G], [* ]re-e-e-ed, re-e-e-ed)
{end_of_post_chorus}

{start_of_outro: label="Outro"}
And that's [F]Why he's spinning '[Am]round in my head
[G]Comes back to me, burning red,[F] [* ]ye[Am]ah, yeah [G]
{end_of_outro}

{start_of_tag: label="Tag"}
Loving him is like [F]driving a new Maser[Am]ati
Down a dead end[G] [* ]street
