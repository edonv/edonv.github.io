The *RA Box* and its companion app, *RA Hub*, is a project designed to function as a universal remote controlled by your phone. By using a Raspberry Pi computer and a companion iOS app, you can control any device via IR.

The software running on the Raspberry Pi is based in Python and MQTT, while RA Hub is pure Swift that uses MQTT for communications.
