[G] [* ]I'm gonna [D/F#]make a change,[Em] [* ]for [D]once in my [C]life
It's gonna f[G]eel real [D/F#]good, gonna make a [Em]difference, gonna [D]make it r[C]ight
As I[G] [* ]turn up the [D/F#]collar on[Em] [* ]my favorite [D]winter coat,[C] [* ]this wind is blowin' my mind
I see the [G]kids in the [D/F#]street, with not e[Em]nough to eat[D]
Who am I,[C] [* ]to be blind, pretending not to see their needs

{start_of_prechorus: label="Pre-Chorus 1"}
[Am7] [* ]A summer's disregard,[G/B] [* ]a broken bottle top
[C] [* ]And a one man's s[G/B]oul
They [Am7]follow each other on the wi[G/B]nd ya' know
'Cause they g[C]ot nowhere to go,[D] [* ]that's why I want you to know

[G] [* ]I'm [G/B]starting with the [C]man in the [D]mirror
[G] [* ]I'm [G/B]asking him to [C]change his w[D]ays
[G] [* ]And no [G/B]message could have [C]been any [A7]clearer
If you w[Dm7]anna make the world a better place
Take a [Dm7]look at yourself, and then make a change

[G] [* ]I've been a [D/F#]victim of [Em] [* ]a selfish [D]kind of love,[C] [* ]it's time that I realize
There are [G]some with no [D/F#]home, not a [Em]nickel to loan[D]
Could it be[C] [* ]really me, pretending that they're not alone?
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_prechorus: label="Pre-Chorus 2"}
[Am7] [* ]A widow deeply scarred,[G/B] [* ]somebody's broken heart
[C] [* ]And a washed-out dr[G/B]eam
They [Am7]follow the pattern of the wi[G/B]nd, ya' see
'Cause they [C]got no place to be,[D] [* ]that's why I'm starting with me
{end_of_prechorus}
