{end_of_ly}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 1"}
I'm [G]gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware
Well, I've [C]never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair[G]
I'm [G]gonna be the main event like no king was before
I'm [C]brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar[G]
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 1"}
Thus [Am]far a rather uninspiring [D]thing
Oh, I [C]just can't [D]wait to be [G]king
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 2"}
No one saying [C]do this
No one saying [Am]be there
No one saying [D]stop that
No one saying [G]see here
[C]Free to run around all [D]day
[C]Free to do it [D]all my [G]way
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 3"}
[G]I think its time that you and I arranged a heart to heart
[C]Kings don't need advice from little [G]hornbills for a start
[G]If this is where the monarchy is headed count me out
Out of [C]service, out of Africa, I [G]wouldn't hang about
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 2"}
This [C]child is getting [Am]wildly out of [D]wing
Oh, I [C]just can't [D]wait to be [G]king
{end_of_chorus}

{start_of_ly: label="Interlude\n(x2)"}

{end_of_ly}

{start_of_verse: label="Verse 4"}
Everybody [C]look left
Everybody [Am]look right
Everywhere you [D]look I'm
Standing in the [G]spotlight
[N.C.]Not yet!
{end_of_verse}

{start_of_chorus: label="Chorus 3"}
Let [C]every [G]creature [D]go for [C]broke and [D]sing
Let's [C]hear it [G]in the [D]herd and [C]on the [D]wing
It's [C]gonna [G]be King [D]Simba's [C]finest [D]fling
Oh, I [C]just can't [D]wait to be [G]king
Oh, I [C]just can't [D]wait to be [G]king
Oh, I [C]just can't [D]wait to be [G]king
{end_of_chorus}
